This is the front page of my blog website hosted on GitHub pages. My name is tao yu. I am a master student in the DBIIR Lab at Renmin University of China (RUC). During the first year in lab, i did research on Graph computing, and i built actordas, a destributed graph computing engine based on AKKA.

My current work investigates how the popular SQL-on-Hadoop systems handle the sql task, such as [presto](http://prestodb.github.io/), trying to combine the sql module with the destributed graph computing engine.  In the future, I plan to continue my research with a focus on investigating Interactive query with graphs and relationships.

Besides daily researches, I enjoy coding and playing with open source projects.
Main research area is the Graph computing. You can get all blogs displayed in time order in [page](https://rainmaple.github.io/year-archive) and get my resume in
